# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to expand and build on my excel skills learned through out the first module. I was able to create two new analyses: outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date.

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
There is a total of 1,369 theater campaigns in which 839 were successful, 493 failed and 37 that were canceled broken down by month. There was a spike in successful campaigns between May and June.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
There is a total of 1044 projects based on the subcategory of "plays" in which the majority met the goal between 5000 to 9999. No plays were canceled.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
 During the analysis I struggled with the =countifs formula for the number of successful, failed and canceled plays for Outcomes Based on Goals. With the extra help from classmate Kimberly Braud we were able to walk through the forumal to have a better understanding and I was able to complete deliverable 2. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Campaigns were more successful during the 2nd and 3rd quarters. There far less campaigns in the 1st and 4th quarters. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The most successful campaigns were less than 24999 and campaigns that were over 45000 were not as successful. This may be considered outliers.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
I'm not sure of any limitations from this dataset 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A bar graph and/or scatter line of the same data set represents itself very well.
